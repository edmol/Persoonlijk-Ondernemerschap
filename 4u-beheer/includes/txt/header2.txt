As configured, the db connection is made before the header is included.
If you had some reason to query the db before displaying the form,
and if you need to do this for all tables, then you can do it in
the included header file.

Checking $_GET['PME_sys_rec'] would pretty well limit the query to 
take place in Add, Change, and coPy modes.

$link_heading = 'hello';

if(isset($_GET['PME_sys_rec']) && $_GET['PME_sys_rec'] !=''){

	if($row = mysql_fetch_row(mysql_query('SELECT `name`, `hex` FROM `demo_colors` LIMIT 1'))){

	   $link_heading .= ' - '.stripslashes(trim($row[0])).($row[0] != $row[1] ? ' - '.stripslashes(trim($row[1])) : '');

	}else{

	   $link_heading .= mysql_error();

	}

}
